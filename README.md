# AnaloGA

Code accompanying the workshop on genetic algorithms (GA) at Girls' Day 2019. 
Most of the workshop took place using "analogue" means, hence the name AnaloGA. 
The core of the workshop took place offline, off-computer. The code presented
in this repository represents the digital-to-analogue and analogue-to-digital
transfer of the presented problem, enabling us to develop the GA with physical 
(or other) means.
